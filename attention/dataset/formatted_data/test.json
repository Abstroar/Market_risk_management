The fastest\nsupercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations per\nsecond, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personal\ncomputers.\n    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mln\nto 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach\n600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and\n10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation for\nany standard computer company.        \n    But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasized\nthat a host of new applications should increase total industry\nshipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.\n    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the\nmachines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of\nair over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.\n    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street\nbrokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of\nsupercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock\ntrading patterns faster than any of their competitors.\n    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,\nare now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are\nfaster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create\nfinancial models of the stock and bond markets.\n    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual\nsupercomputers are found on Wall Street.\n    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that\nsupercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies\nprovide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control\nData behemoths.\n    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology\ncalled parallel processing, in which a number of internal\nprocessors work together to solve a problem.\n    With such systems a problem is broken up and different\nsegments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,\nstandard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,\nor sequentially.\n    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many as\neight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32\nbillion operations per second.\n    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida State\nUniversity, has only two processors, later to be expanded to\nfour.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 represents\na drastic change in architecture from parent company Control\nData's Cyber system.\n    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 contains\nabout 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto a\nboard about the size of a standard newspaper section.\n    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 miles\nof embedded wiring.\n    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputer\nbut Thorndyke said he expects much faster development time\nframes in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.\n    \"We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the last\nleap,\" he said.\n    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastest\ncomputer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection Machine\nModel CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, but\nit is a very specialized architecture only meant for certain\nvery specific applications.\n    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses a\ntechnology called \"massive parallism.\" It contains 64,000\nprocessors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors all\nwork on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.\n    It is an ideal tool for applications with many\nunpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for\nNovon Research Group. \"The more unpredictable things are, the\nmore the Thinking Machine will be appropriate,\" he said.       \n\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq A and W Brands Inc said it\nfiled a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission for a proposed public offering of 3,400,000 shares\nof common.\n    The company anticipates that the price of the offering will\nrange between 13 dlrs and 15 dlrs a share.\n    It said the offering is expected in mid May through a group\nof underwriters managed by First Boston Corp and Montgomery\nSecurities.\n    It said it will use the proceeds to repay its debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Poland's winter wheat is likely to\nsurvive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be\nknown until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.\n    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive\nground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman\nTeresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.\n    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly\nmelted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should\nnot be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be\ndamaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots\nmay be exposed to night frosts.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq The Finance Ministry is putting the\nfinishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary\nbudget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to\nnext year's main budget, ministry officials said.\n    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the\n6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government\nunveiled last month to boost domestic demand.\n    Ministry officials said the government would issue about\n1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the\nincreased public investment set out in the emergency package.\n    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by\n450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in\nNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than\nexpected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.\n    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the\n1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than\n1,000 billion yen.

measures, the IPMA also decided that the\ncriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of\nthe smaller firms.\n    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead\nmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally\ndistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of\neight other major currencies.\n    The former requirement called for three lead-managed\nissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance\nrequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six\nto 10 members.\n    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict\nmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive\nand that it reinforces the big firms' already large market\nshare.\n    \"Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with\nborrowers,\" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. \"The borrower\nsays to himself, \"Well I can travel economy or I can travel\nfirst class,'\" he said.\n    Sibson defended the new rules saying \"We have to steer a\ncourse between representing the interests of the major market\nmakers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody.\"\n    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expanded\nto the point where the former minimum size requirements were\njust too small.\n    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with the\nAssociation of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,\nsubmitting daily information on prices on issues in which they\nare market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to be\ndetermined.\n    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and\nsecondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriate\nmarket price for their securities. Such a rule would make\ninvestors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and\nwould increase liquidity, they said.\n    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yet\nbeen spelled out. But previous discussion of the reporting\nrequirement considered firms listing the closing price of a\ngiven security as well as the high and low for the day.\n     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on the\nimplementation of a new communications system which enables a\nlead manager to invite all potential management group members\nin to a deal at the same time.\n REUTER\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq New Zealand's unemployment rate fell\nto 6.0 pct of the workforce at the end of February from 6.1 pct\nin January but was above the 4.3 pct level of February 1986,\nthe labour department said.\n    It said the number of unemployed fell to 78,711 from 81,558\nin January, and compared with 57,103 in February 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq The European Community (EC) executive\nCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a new\ninitiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the\nbloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.\n    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what\ndiplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint\nmeeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in\nLuxembourg Monday.\n    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans\nAndriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present\nfarm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for\n1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were\nfirst announced in March.\n    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a\nplan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance\nrapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures\nwhich would change the way common EC farm prices are converted\ninto member state currencies.\n    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans\nfiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax\nplan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a\nchance of agreement on other aspects of the package.\n      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to\nfarmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.\n      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would\ninclude plans for revising the current oils and fats and\ncurrency regulations.\n     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in\nmeetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues\ncould then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at\nthe end of the month.\n    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure\nthe summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means\nof financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be\n\"disastrous\" if farm issues had to be discussed by government\nleaders.\n    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75\nbillion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,\nthe Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the\ntraditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said\n    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired\nyesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some\naspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to\nbe referred to the summit.\n    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as\nuseful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed\nto have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.\n    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have\nlined up with the four others already opposing the oils and\nfats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Lockheed Corp has received an 80.0\nmln dlr contract for engineering support services for high\nenergy laser facilities, the Defense Department said.\n REUTER\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd is issuing a\n100 mln dlr convertible eurobond due March 31, 2002 paying an\nindicated coupon of two pct lead managed by Takugin\nInternational, bookrunner Yamaichi International Ltd said.\n    The par-priced issue is callable from 1990 at 104 pct\ndeclining by 1/2 pct per annum to par thereafter but is not\ncallable until 1991 unless the share price exceeds the\nconversion price by 150 pct.\n    Final terms will be fixed on April 9.

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\nwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\ngrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\ncouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\nviews, bankers said.\n    \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\nPfister.\n    \"Poehl is in a dilemma.

The extra amount this costs the\ngovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\nwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\nmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\nSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\nallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\nlosses for the CDU in state elections.\n    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\nweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\nremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\nwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\nyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\ngave Poehl another eight-year term.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\nhoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\nnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\nBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n REUTER\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq China's oil drilling industry is one of\nthe few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about\n1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100\nexpected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleum\nofficial said.\n    \"In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,\nand does not depend on the international price of oil,\" Zhai\nGuang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,\ntold Reuters.\n    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced at\nabout one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price established\nby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai said\nin an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.\n    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the United\nStates where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in the\nnumber of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765\nlast week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.\n    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operation\nthan any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, another\nmember of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.\n    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfield\nequipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,\ninternational sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.\n    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activity\nis on land and under the control of the Chinese government\nwhich requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.\n    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment for\nChina's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate in\nthe actual drilling, he said.\n    Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in\n1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.\n    \"We're encouraged,\" said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco's\nforeign affairs, \"but we need substantial reserves before we\ncan do commercial production in a remote area like that.\"\n     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130\nmln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annually\nby the year 2,000.\n    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, with\nultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Shr loss 43 cts vs profit eight cts\n    Net loss 3.1 mln vs profit 502,896\n    Revs 5.6 mln vs 4.2 mln\n    NOTE:1986 net includes negative effect of accounting change\nof 354,650 or five cts a share.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Advertising agents Saatchi and Saatchi Co\nPlc <SACHY> said it was buying <Cleveland Consulting Associates\nInc> for an initial consideration of 2.0 mln dlrs.\n    Additional payments may be made annually through the year\nending March 31, 1991 to bring the total consideration up to\n9.5 pct of Cleveland's average post-tax profits in the last two\nyears of the period.\n    The purchase of Cleveland is a further step in Saatchi and\nSaatchi's fast growing consulting industry, the company said.\nIt said its consulting operations now provide a platform for\nmajor future expansion.\n    For the 12 months ended 31 March 1986, Cleveland had\n479,000 dlrs in pretax profits and forecasts one mln for 1987.\n    At the Saatchi and Saatchi annual meeting today, the\ncompany reported a particularly strong start to the current\nyear, with profits sharply higher than the same period last\nyear.\n    Saatchi and Saatchi shares rose one pence on the Cleveland\nannouncement to 885p after yesterday's 870p close.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq President Reagan said the United\nStates would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile\nreductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow.\n    Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the\nWhite House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max\nKampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for\nconsultations later this week.

But in the\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\n    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\n    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\nsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently\nlinked to a basket of currencies while the other five\ncurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to the\nU.S. Dollar.\n    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation\nagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,\nbut plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of\n7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.\n    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued\nslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the\nundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.\n REUTER\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq McFarland Energy Inc\nsaid its board and that of Petrominerals Corp have approved a\ndefinitive agreement for McFarland to acquire Petrominerals in\nan exchange of stock.\n    McFarland said it would exchange one common share for each\n5.4 Petrominerals shares.

 Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for\nmore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third\nof French unemployed, government figures show.\n    The main measures of the

But even if German banking authorities\nagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on\nhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.\n    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of\nformulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in\nswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial\nintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.\nThis is the so-called market-to-market value.\n    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too\ncomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of\nlending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of\nthe borrowers involved, the sources said.\n    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended\nto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public\nauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign\nbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.\n    A further complication is that the more flexible\ndefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put\nGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.\n    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of\nthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.\nAnd British authorities, the sources said.\n    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated\nforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be\nbrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite\nthe fact that the risk may be entirely different.\n    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was\nuncertain.

account deficit looked likely to\nfall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in\n1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.\n    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr\npayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.\n    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50\ndlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18\ndlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes\nincreasingly ragged.\n    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in\nforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its\ntrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last\nyear's 18.4 pct drop.\n    The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year\nand 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break\nthrough the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in\n1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.\n    \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle\nof descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather\nthan a three-point landing,\" the EIU said.\n    \"Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the\nFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and\nCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to\nmore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter\nU.S. Fiscal policy,\" it said.\n    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the\nwillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government\nassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.\n    \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, adding that\nif Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would\ncollapse.\n    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates\nwould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt\ncrisis, it said.\n    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look \"increasingly\nsick.\"\n    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen\nslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to\n4.2 pct in 1988, it said.\n    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest\nsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature a\nsluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in\nDecember, the EIU said.\n    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West\nGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while\nJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.\nExporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more\ncompetitively-priced dollar.\n    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and\noil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.\n    However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over\nthe current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices\nwill show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first\ntime since 1984, the EIU said.\n    After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of\ninternationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in\n1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.\n    It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6\npct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Shr 61 cts vs 55 cts\n    Net 726,000 vs 669,000\n    Nine mths\n    Shr 1.78 dlrs vs 1.63 dlrs\n    Net 2,133,000 vs 1,960,000\n    NOTE: Full name is First Oak Brook Bancshares Inc\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Credit Commercial de France <CCFP.PA>\nreported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln\nfrancs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its\ndenationalisation around the end of this month.\n    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in\nterms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,\n\nplanned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer\nahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to\nthe public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.\n    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was\nnationalised by the Socialists in 1982.\n    The sources said it was too early to give details of the\nplanned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a\nlikely date for the flotation launch.\n    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33\nmln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to\nlarge private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to\nten shareholders before the flotation.\n    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln\nfranc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.\n\"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,\"\nCCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.\n    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation\nat between four and five billion francs.\n    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least\nthe same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recently\nprivatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.\n    The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also\nincluded the sale of Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere\nde Paribas <PARI.PA>.

But they would be given a much\ngreater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert\nHeller, who joined the board last August.\n    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\nargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\nadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\nvolatility of exchange rates.\n    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\ncommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\n    His idea, which many conservative economists find\nappealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\nrecent years by President Reagan.\n    It would complement the present system of opening or\nclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\nkey indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\nthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to\nchanges in interest rates and affect economic activity\ndirectly.\n    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\nis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\npolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\nbase.\n    \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\nserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\npurposes,\" says Heller.\n    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States\nwent off the gold standard because the global economy had\nvastly outstripped gold supplies.\n    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\nhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\nproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.\n    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\n1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\n    But the current system of floating currencies in which\ncurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\nmonetary system, is also being widely questioned.\n    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\nformal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\ncurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\nmajor problems with this also.\n    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\nmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\ndetrimental to their own domestic economy.\n    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\nmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\nwith the fundamental judgement.\n    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\nto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\ncope with their overpowering debt problems.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's\nchief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\nGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a\nforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\neconomic matters.\n   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind\nclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\nposturing.\n   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\nprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\ninternational exchange rates.\n    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major\ncommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\nand prices would be measured on a regular basis.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\npolicy might be eased,\" he says.\n    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\nmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\nvirtually continuous basis.\n    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\ntraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\nfor the entire world,\" he says.\n    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\nproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\nproduction processes.\n    \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\nindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\nthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\nmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\n    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity\nsuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by\nthe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.\n    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow\nmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity\nto the rest of the system and to other commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003 endseq": "", "startseq Shr 95 cts vs 83 cts\n    Shr diluted 89 cts vs 80 cts\n    Net 2,297,842 vs 1,782,764\n

believe that all three of the\nFederal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have\ncontracted in February.\n    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the\nFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid\ngrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the\nweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy\nwas justified on account of weakness in the economy.    \n    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported\ntoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary\nforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.\nThe monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.\n    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.\nWith other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit\naccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is\nset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.\n    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional\nlink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of\nfalling interest rates and banking deregulation.\n    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is\nlikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch\nEconomics Inc.\n    \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all\nsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows\nat the Fed,\" McCarthy said.\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"    \n    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\nslowdown in the business expansion.\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\nprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\nthey were a month ago,\" he noted.\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You'd\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"\n    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\nway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line\nwith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc\nargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to\nsolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade\ndeficit.

However,\nthey stress that money growth will not be strong enough to\nprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the\neconomy shows evidence of weakness.\n    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,\nSlifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money\nmarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four\nbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's\nweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2\nand M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.\n    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return\nto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so\ncontinue to present no problem for the Fed.\n    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with\nits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps\nseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether or\nnot to ease its grip on reserves.\n    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts\nagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose\nto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next\nchanges policy.\n    \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as\nlow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six\npct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust.
